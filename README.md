This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and SQLite3.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploys smoothly on Heroku. Other deployments may need a separate database server because of the serverless nature of NextJS API functions.
